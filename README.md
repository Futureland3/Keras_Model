# LeNet Handwritten Digit Recognition
## Overview
This project implements the LeNet neural network architecture to classify handwritten digits using the EMNIST dataset. It includes the complete machine learning pipeline, from data preprocessing and model training to evaluation and real-time prediction through an interactive GUI.

## Features
Data Preprocessing: Normalizes and transforms the EMNIST dataset.
Model Training: Configurable training with different optimizers, learning rates, and epochs.
Fine-Tuning: Adapts a pre-trained MNIST model for EMNIST classification.
Evaluation: Includes performance metrics, confusion matrices, and an automated best model selection.
Interactive GUI: Allows users to draw digits and see predictions in real time.
